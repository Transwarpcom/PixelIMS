## About

PixelIMS is a tool that allows you to enable or disable IMS features like Voice over LTE (VoLTE), Wi-Fi Calling (VoWiFi), Video Calling (VT), and 5G Voice (VoNR) on Google Pixel phones. It requires [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) to work.

## Features

- **System Information**: Displays your device's app version, Android version, and security patch version.
- **Shizuku Status**: Shows the current status of Shizuku and allows for refreshing permissions.
- **Logcat Viewer**: View and expert application logs for debugging purposes.
- **Sim Card Selection**: Apply settings to a specific SIM card or all SIM cards at once.
- **Customizable IMS Features**:
    - **Carrier Name**: Override the carrier name displayed on your device.
  - **IMS User Agent**: Override the IMS User Agent string.
    - **VoLTE (Voice over LTE)**: Enable high-definition voice calls over 4G.
    - **VoWiFi (Wi-Fi Calling)**: Make calls over Wi-Fi networks, with options for Wi-Fi only mode.
    - **VT (Video Calling)**: Enable IMS-based video calls.
    - **VoNR (Voice over 5G)**: Enable high-definition voice calls over 5G (Requires Android 14+).
    - **Cross-SIM Calling**: Enable dual-SIM interconnection features.
    - **UT (Supplementary Services)**: Enable call forwarding, call waiting, and other supplementary services over UT.
    - **5G NR**: Enable 5G NSA (Non-Standalone) and SA (Standalone) networks.
    - **5G Signal Strength Thresholds**: Option to apply custom 5G signal strength thresholds.
- **Configuration Persistence**: Automatically saves configuration per SIM card.

> **Note:** Country ISO customization has been removed from PixelIMS. If you need this feature, please use [carrier-ims-for-pixel](https://github.com/ryfineZ/carrier-ims-for-pixel).

## About this Project

This project originated as a fork of [Mystery00/TurboIMS](https://github.com/Mystery00/TurboIMS) and was renamed to PixelIMS by Transwarpcom. Due to various stability issues encountered during usage, the codebase has undergone a complete refactoring. This includes rewriting the core logic for SIM card reading and carrier configuration, as well as redesigning the UI and icons.

Additionally, new features such as **Carrier Name Modification** and **Log Viewer** have been introduced. Although this project retains the original fork relationship, the code logic has fundamentally changed and is almost entirely unrelated to the original project. Therefore, there are no plans to merge upstream code in the future. As a tool used daily by myself and my friends, I will continue to maintain it as long as there is demand.
